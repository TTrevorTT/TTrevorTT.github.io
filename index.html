<p>Today I went out and rode with my bike computer for the first time! It was a blast, being able to see live data like my heart rate, speed, distance and so much more is very interesting. This will make my training better as I will be able to ride in heart rate zones more accurately.</p>

<h3>Complete my first 50 mile bike ride! <small>05/26/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="./Images/First_50_Mile_ride.jpg" width="500" height="300">
<p>Today I planned to ride for 3 hours total. I decided a good way to time this was to ride out for 1 hour and 30 minutes one way and then turn around and ride back for 1 hour and 30 Minutes. However, after getting back I noticed I was only 3 miles away from 50 miles. At this point, I was extremely exhausted, tired and a little dehydrated. The temperature was about 100(F), but I wanted to keep riding. I was thinking if I stopped right now I would never be able to look at this ride in my history because I would just see how close I was to 50 and that I quit. So I set back out and rode for another 3 miles and finished with 50 total miles! I also decided to sign up for a bike ride event in August!</p>

<p>I bought this bike as a birthday present to my self and while buying my bike today I thought it would be a fun and good idea to start a blog about my experience biking. I'm not sure how biking will go, but I enjoyed biking while I was a kid so I have good thoughts about this!</p>
